# Employee department example

Demonstrates the effects of data inconsistencies in Hibernate's object graph using a basic Employee-Department many-to-one relation. This code is based on the Accessing data JPA example from the [Spring Boot getting started guide](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-accessing-data-jpa/tree/main/complete).

This example is featured in my [article about model-driven ORM](https://martijnvogten.github.io/the-basic-mistake-all-orms-make-and-how-to-fix-it).

### How to run the example

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
